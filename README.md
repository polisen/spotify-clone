### [Live Project Demo](https://portfolio-spotify-clone.web.app/)


### Preface

This project is simply to showcase some UI/UX proficiency as well as building advanced custom hooks - as shown with the useAudioPlayer hook.

I didn't want to use any back-end  for ease of setup so the playlists are hardcoded - which means that the tracks are whatever I had on my computer, so sorry in advance for the, let's say, eclectic selection.

As of now, it's not responsive to fit mobile. This is a high priority issue.

Instructions:

- `clone https://github.com/polisen/spotify-clone.git`
- `yarn install && yarn start`
- Alternatively `yarn test`
- Visit `localhost:3000`
